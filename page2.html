<p> The one think I miss the most about South Africa is the food.<b> This song is the South African Anthem for the best foods there are to eat. Boereworse is like an Italian sausage but with different seasoning.<br>The tast is unlike anything I have had here in the US.<br> Chappies define my childhood, I have so many memories of going to the shop up the road by my school to get some with my pocket money. </p>

<br>
<p> One of the most vivid memories I have of living in South Africa is the sound of the Hadeda,<br> which is the "turkey"of South Africa.<br> They make the most obnoxious annoying sound ever.</p> <br>

<br>
<p>Along with all of the amazing food and nature of the country, there are some downsides to living there.<b> I remember many night with no power for "loadshedding" which is when the entire country has no electricity to save electricity.<b> Things like think make be greatful to not live in a third world country anymore but in a weird way I miss it. </p> <b>

  <p> Although South African is a distant memory for me now, it still holds a very speascial place in my heart and I will forever be South African at heart.
