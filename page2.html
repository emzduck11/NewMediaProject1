<p> The one think I miss the most about South Africa is the food.<b> This song is the South African Anthem for the best foods there are to eat.<br> </p>

<p> One of the most vivid memories I have of living in South Africa is the sound of the Hadeda,<br> which is the "turkey"of South Africa.<br> They make the most obnoxious annoying sound ever.</p> <br>

<br>
<p>Along with all of the amazing food and nature of the country, there are some downsides to living there.<b> I remember many night with no power for "loadshedding" which is when the entire country has no electricity to save electricity.<b> Things like think make be greatful to not live in a third world country anymore but in a weird way I miss it. </p> <b>
